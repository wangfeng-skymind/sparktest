¡°Put my bag in the front bedroom, Calpurnia,¡± was the first thing Aunt Alexandra said.
¡°Jean Louise, stop scratching your head,¡± was the second thing she said.
Calpurnia picked up Aunty¡¯s heavy suitcase and opened the door. ¡°I¡¯ll take it,¡± saidJem, and took it. I heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump. The sound hada dull permanence about it. ¡°Have you come for a visit, Aunty?¡± I asked. AuntAlexandra¡¯s visits from the Landing were rare, and she traveled in state. She owned abright green square Buick and a black chauffeur, both kept in an unhealthy state oftidiness, but today they were nowhere to be seen.
¡°Didn¡¯t your father tell you?¡± she asked.
Jem and I shook our heads.
¡°Probably he forgot. He¡¯s not in yet, is he?¡±
¡°Nome, he doesn¡¯t usually get back till late afternoon,¡± said Jem.
¡°Well, your father and I decided it was time I came to stay with you for a while.¡±
¡°For a while¡± in Maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years. Jem and Iexchanged glances.
¡°Jem¡¯s growing up now and you are too,¡± she said to me. ¡°We decided that it would bebest for you to have some feminine influence. It won¡¯t be many years, Jean Louise,before you become interested in clothes and boys¡ª¡±
I could have made several answers to this: Cal¡¯s a girl, it would be many years beforeI would be interested in boys, I would never be interested in clothes¡­ but I kept quiet.
¡°What about Uncle Jimmy?¡± asked Jem. ¡°Is he comin¡®, too?¡±
¡°Oh no, he¡¯s staying at the Landing. He¡¯ll keep the place going.¡±
The moment I said, ¡°Won¡¯t you miss him?¡± I realized that this was not a tactfulquestion. Uncle Jimmy present or Uncle Jimmy absent made not much difference, henever said anything. Aunt Alexandra ignored my question.
I could think of nothing else to say to her. In fact I could never think of anything to sayto her, and I sat thinking of past painful conversations between us: How are you, JeanLouise? Fine, thank you ma¡¯am, how are you? Very well, thank you, what have youbeen doing with yourself? Nothin¡®. Don¡¯t you do anything? Nome. Certainly you havefriends? Yessum. Well what do you all do? Nothin¡¯.
It was plain that Aunty thought me dull in the extreme, because I once heard her tellAtticus that I was sluggish.
There was a story behind all this, but I had no desire to extract it from her then. Todaywas Sunday, and Aunt Alexandra was positively irritable on the Lord¡¯s Day. I guess itwas her Sunday corset. She was not fat, but solid, and she chose protective garmentsthat drew up her bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her waist, flared out her rear, andmanaged to suggest that Aunt Alexandra¡¯s was once an hour-glass figure. From anyangle, it was formidable.
The remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends whenrelatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway. It wasAtticus, home from Montgomery. Jem, forgetting his dignity, ran with me to meet him.
Jem seized his briefcase and bag, I jumped into his arms, felt his vague dry kiss andsaid, ¡°¡®d you bring me a book? ¡¯d you know Aunty¡¯s here?¡±
Atticus answered both questions in the affirmative. ¡°How¡¯d you like for her to come livewith us?¡±
I said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie under certaincircumstances and at all times when one can¡¯t do anything about them.
¡°We felt it was time you children needed¡ªwell, it¡¯s like this, Scout,¡± Atticus said. ¡°Youraunt¡¯s doing me a favor as well as you all. I can¡¯t stay here all day with you, and thesummer¡¯s going to be a hot one.¡±
¡°Yes sir,¡± I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea, however, that AuntAlexandra¡¯s appearance on the scene was not so much Atticus¡¯s doing as hers. Auntyhad a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose her coming to livewith us was in that category.
Maycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so loaded withshinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long visits with Aunt Alexandra,consisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking her head and saying, ¡°Uh, uh, uh.¡± MissRachel next door had Aunty over for coffee in the afternoons, and Mr. Nathan Radleywent so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her.
When she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra seemedas if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary Society refreshments added to herreputation as a hostess (she did not permit Calpurnia to make the delicacies required tosustain the Society through long reports on Rice Christians); she joined and becameSecretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all parties present and participating inthe life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one of the last of her kind: she had river-boat,boarding-school manners; let any moral come along and she would uphold it; she wasborn in the objective case; she was an incurable gossip. When Aunt Alexandra went toschool, self-doubt could not be found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning. Shewas never bored, and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royalprerogative: she would arrange, advise, caution, and warn.
She never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal groupsto the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused Jem rather than annoyed him:
¡°Aunty better watch how she talks¡ªscratch most folks in Maycomb and they¡¯re kin tous.¡±
Aunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweather¡¯s suicide, said itwas caused by a morbid streak in the family. Let a sixteen-year-old girl giggle in thechoir and Aunty would say, ¡°It just goes to show you, all the Penfield women are flighty.¡±
Everybody in Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a Drinking Streak, a Gambling Streak,a Mean Streak, a Funny Streak.
Once, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawford¡¯s tendency to mind otherpeople¡¯s business was hereditary, Atticus said, ¡°Sister, when you stop to think about it,our generation¡¯s practically the first in the Finch family not to marry its cousins. Wouldyou say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak?¡±
Aunty said no, that¡¯s where we got our small hands and feet.
I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received theimpression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the sense theyhad, but Aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer afamily had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.
¡°That makes the Ewells fine folks, then,¡± said Jem. The tribe of which Burris Ewell andhis brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the Maycomb dump,and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations.
Aunt Alexandra¡¯s theory had something behind it, though. Maycomb was an ancienttown. It was twenty miles east of Finch¡¯s Landing, awkwardly inland for such an oldtown. But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only tavern in the territory. Sinkfield, no patriot, served and suppliedammunition to Indians and settlers alike, neither knowing or caring whether he was apart of the Alabama Territory or the Creek Nation so long as business was good.
Business was excellent when Governor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting thenewly created county¡¯s domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate itsexact center and there establish its seat of government. The surveyors, Sinkfield¡¯sguests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of Maycomb County, andshowed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built. Had not Sinkfieldmade a bold stroke to preserve his holdings, Maycomb would have sat in the middle ofWinston Swamp, a place totally devoid of interest. Instead, Maycomb grew andsprawled out from its hub, Sinkfield¡¯s Tavern, because Sinkfield reduced his guests tomyopic drunkenness one evening, induced them to bring forward their maps and charts,lop off a little here, add a bit there, and adjust the center of the county to meet hisrequirements. He sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts ofshinny in their saddlebags¡ªtwo apiece and one for the Governor.
Because its primary reason for existence was government, Maycomb was spared thegrubbiness that distinguished most Alabama towns its size. In the beginning its buildingswere solid, its courthouse proud, its streets graciously wide. Maycomb¡¯s proportion ofprofessional people ran high: one went there to have his teeth pulled, his wagon fixed,his heart listened to, his money deposited, his soul saved, his mules vetted. But theultimate wisdom of Sinkfield¡¯s maneuver is open to question. He placed the young towntoo far away from the only kind of public transportation in those days¡ªriver-boat¡ªand ittook a man from the north end of the county two days to travel to Maycomb for store-bought goods. As a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years, anisland in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland.
Although Maycomb was ignored during the War Between the States, Reconstructionrule and economic ruin forced the town to grow. It grew inward. New people so rarelysettled there, the same families married the same families until the members of thecommunity looked faintly alike. Occasionally someone would return from Montgomery orMobile with an outsider, but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of familyresemblance. Things were more or less the same during my early years.
There was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked this way: theolder citizens, the present generation of people who had lived side by side for years andyears, were utterly predictable to one another: they took for granted attitudes, charactershadings, even gestures, as having been repeated in each generation and refined bytime. Thus the dicta No Crawford Minds His Own Business, Every Third Merriweather IsMorbid, The Truth Is Not in the Delafields, All the Bufords Walk Like That, were simplyguides to daily living: never take a check from a Delafield without a discreet call to thebank; Miss Maudie Atkinson¡¯s shoulder stoops because she was a Buford; if Mrs. GraceMerriweather sips gin out of Lydia E. Pinkham bottles it¡¯s nothing unusual¡ªher motherdid the same.
Aunt Alexandra fitted into the world of Maycomb like a hand into a glove, but neverinto the world of Jem and me. I so often wondered how she could be Atticus¡¯s and UncleJack¡¯s sister that I revived half-remembered tales of changelings and mandrake rootsthat Jem had spun long ago.
These were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay, as she had little tosay to Jem or me, and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went tobed. It was summer and we were outdoors. Of course some afternoons when I wouldrun inside for a drink of water, I would find the livingroom overrun with Maycomb ladies,sipping, whispering, fanning, and I would be called: ¡°Jean Louise, come speak to theseladies.¡±
When I appeared in the doorway, Aunty would look as if she regretted her request; Iwas usually mud-splashed or covered with sand.
¡°Speak to your Cousin Lily,¡± she said one afternoon, when she had trapped me in thehall.
¡°Who?¡± I said.
¡°Your Cousin Lily Brooke,¡± said Aunt Alexandra.
¡°She our cousin? I didn¡¯t know that.¡±
Aunt Alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to CousinLily and firm disapproval to me. When Cousin Lily Brooke left I knew I was in for it.
It was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the Finch Family, or toinstall any pride into his children. She summoned Jem, who sat warily on the sofabeside me. She left the room and returned with a purple-covered book on whichMeditations of Joshua S. St. Clair was stamped in gold.
¡°Your cousin wrote this,¡± said Aunt Alexandra. ¡°He was a beautiful character.¡±
Jem examined the small volume. ¡°Is this the Cousin Joshua who was locked up for solong?¡±
Aunt Alexandra said, ¡°How did you know that?¡±
¡°Why, Atticus said he went round the bend at the University. Said he tried to shoot thepresident. Said Cousin Joshua said he wasn¡¯t anything but a sewer-inspector and triedto shoot him with an old flintlock pistol, only it just blew up in his hand. Atticus said itcost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that one¡ª¡±
Aunt Alexandra was standing stiff as a stork. ¡°That¡¯s all,¡± she said. ¡°We¡¯ll see aboutthis.¡±
Before bedtime I was in Jem¡¯s room trying to borrow a book, when Atticus knockedand entered. He sat on the side of Jem¡¯s bed, looked at us soberly, then he grinned.
¡°Er¡ªh¡¯rm,¡± he said. He was beginning to preface some things he said with a throatynoise, and I thought he must at last be getting old, but he looked the same. ¡±I don¡¯texactly know how to say this,¡° he began.
¡°Well, just say it,¡± said Jem. ¡°Have we done something?¡±
Our father was actually fidgeting. ¡°No, I just want to explain to you that¡ªyour AuntAlexandra asked me¡­ son, you know you¡¯re a Finch, don¡¯t you?¡±
¡°That¡¯s what I¡¯ve been told.¡± Jem looked out of the corners of his eyes. His voice roseuncontrollably, ¡°Atticus, what¡¯s the matter?¡±
Atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. ¡°I¡¯m trying to tell you the facts of life.¡±
Jem¡¯s disgust deepened. ¡°I know all that stuff,¡± he said.
Atticus suddenly grew serious. In his lawyer¡¯s voice, without a shade of inflection, hesaid: ¡°Your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and Jean Louise that youare not from run-of-the-mill people, that you are the product of several generations¡¯
gentle breeding¡ª¡± Atticus paused, watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg.
¡°Gentle breeding,¡± he continued, when I had found and scratched it, ¡°and that youshould try to live up to your name¡ª¡± Atticus persevered in spite of us: ¡°She asked me totell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are. She wantsto talk to you about the family and what it¡¯s meant to Maycomb County through theyears, so you¡¯ll have some idea of who you are, so you might be moved to behaveaccordingly,¡± he concluded at a gallop.
Stunned, Jem and I looked at each other, then at Atticus, whose collar seemed toworry him. We did not speak to him.
Presently I picked up a comb from Jem¡¯s dresser and ran its teeth along the edge.
¡°Stop that noise,¡± Atticus said.
His curtness stung me. The comb was midway in its journey, and I banged it down.
For no reason I felt myself beginning to cry, but I could not stop. This was not my father.
My father never thought these thoughts. My father never spoke so. Aunt Alexandra hadput him up to this, somehow. Through my tears I saw Jem standing in a similar pool ofisolation, his head cocked to one side.
There was nowhere to go, but I turned to go and met Atticus¡¯s vest front. I buried myhead in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the light bluecloth: his watch ticking, the faint crackle of his starched shirt, the soft sound of hisbreathing.
¡°Your stomach¡¯s growling,¡± I said.
¡°I know it,¡± he said.
¡°You better take some soda.¡±
¡°I will,¡± he said.
¡°Atticus, is all this behavin¡® an¡¯ stuff gonna make things different? I mean are you¡ª?¡±
I felt his hand on the back of my head. ¡°Don¡¯t you worry about anything,¡± he said. ¡°It¡¯snot time to worry.¡± When I heard that, I knew he had come back to us. The blood in mylegs began to flow again, and I raised my head. ¡°You really want us to do all that? I can¡¯tremember everything Finches are supposed to do¡­¡±
¡°I don¡¯t want you to remember it. Forget it.¡±
He went to the door and out of the room, shutting the door behind him. He nearlyslammed it, but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly. As Jem and Istared, the door opened again and Atticus peered around. His eyebrows were raised,his glasses had slipped. ¡°Get more like Cousin Joshua every day, don¡¯t I? Do you thinkI¡¯ll end up costing the family five hundred dollars?¡±
I know now what he was trying to do, but Atticus was only a man. It takes a woman todo that kind of work.Although we heard no more about the Finch family from Aunt Alexandra, we heardplenty from the town. On Saturdays, armed with our nickels, when Jem permitted me toaccompany him (he was now positively allergic to my presence when in public), wewould squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowds and sometimes hear, ¡°There¡¯shis chillun,¡± or, ¡°Yonder¡¯s some Finches.¡± Turning to face our accusers, we would seeonly a couple of farmers studying the enema bags in the Mayco Drugstore window. Ortwo dumpy countrywomen in straw hats sitting in a Hoover cart.
¡°They c¡¯n go loose and rape up the countryside for all of ¡®em who run this countycare,¡± was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman when hepassed us. Which reminded me that I had a question to ask Atticus.
¡°What¡¯s rape?¡± I asked him that night.
Atticus looked around from behind his paper. He was in his chair by the window. Aswe grew older, Jem and I thought it generous to allow Atticus thirty minutes to himselfafter supper.
He sighed, and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and withoutconsent.
¡°Well if that¡¯s all it is why did Calpurnia dry me up when I asked her what it was?¡±
Atticus looked pensive. ¡°What¡¯s that again?¡±
¡°Well, I asked Calpurnia comin¡® from church that day what it was and she said ask youbut I forgot to and now I¡¯m askin¡¯ you.¡±
His paper was now in his lap. ¡°Again, please,¡± he said.
I told him in detail about our trip to church with Calpurnia. Atticus seemed to enjoy it,but Aunt Alexandra, who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing, put down her embroideryand stared at us.
¡°You all were coming back from Calpurnia¡¯s church that Sunday?¡±
Jem said, ¡°Yessum, she took us.¡±
I remembered something. ¡°Yessum, and she promised me I could come out to herhouse some afternoon. Atticus. I¡¯ll go next Sunday if it¡¯s all right, can I? Cal said she¡¯dcome get me if you were off in the car.¡±
¡°You may not.¡±
Aunt Alexandra said it. I wheeled around, startled, then turned back to Atticus in timeto catch his swift glance at her, but it was too late. I said, ¡°I didn¡¯t ask you!¡±
For a big man, Atticus could get up and down from a chair faster than anyone I everknew. He was on his feet. ¡°Apologize to your aunt,¡± he said.
¡°I didn¡¯t ask her, I asked you¡ª¡±
Atticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye. His voice wasdeadly: ¡°First, apologize to your aunt.¡±
¡°I¡¯m sorry, Aunty,¡± I muttered.
¡°Now then,¡± he said. ¡°Let¡¯s get this clear: you do as Calpurnia tells you, you do as I tellyou, and as long as your aunt¡¯s in this house, you will do as she tells you. Understand?¡±
I understood, pondered a while, and concluded that the only way I could retire with ashred of dignity was to go to the bathroom, where I stayed long enough to make themthink I had to go. Returning, I lingered in the hall to hear a fierce discussion going on inthe livingroom. Through the door I could see Jem on the sofa with a football magazine infront of his face, his head turning as if its pages contained a live tennis match.
¡°¡­you¡¯ve got to do something about her,¡± Aunty was saying. ¡°You¡¯ve let things go ontoo long, Atticus, too long.¡±
¡°I don¡¯t see any harm in letting her go out there. Cal¡¯d look after her there as well asshe does here.¡±
Who was the ¡°her¡± they were talking about? My heart sank: me. I felt the starchedwalls of a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on me, and for the second time in my life Ithought of running away. Immediately.
¡°Atticus, it¡¯s all right to be soft-hearted, you¡¯re an easy man, but you have a daughterto think of. A daughter who¡¯s growing up.¡±
¡°That¡¯s what I am thinking of.¡±
¡°And don¡¯t try to get around it. You¡¯ve got to face it sooner or later and it might as wellbe tonight. We don¡¯t need her now.¡±
Atticus¡¯s voice was even: ¡°Alexandra, Calpurnia¡¯s not leaving this house until shewants to. You may think otherwise, but I couldn¡¯t have got along without her all theseyears. She¡¯s a faithful member of this family and you¡¯ll simply have to accept things theway they are. Besides, sister, I don¡¯t want you working your head off for us¡ªyou¡¯ve noreason to do that. We still need Cal as much as we ever did.¡±
¡°But Atticus¡ª¡±
¡°Besides, I don¡¯t think the children¡¯ve suffered one bit from her having brought themup. If anything, she¡¯s been harder on them in some ways than a mother would havebeen¡­ she¡¯s never let them get away with anything, she¡¯s never indulged them the waymost colored nurses do. She tried to bring them up according to her lights, and Cal¡¯slights are pretty good¡ªand another thing, the children love her.¡±
I breathed again. It wasn¡¯t me, it was only Calpurnia they were talking about. Revived,I entered the livingroom. Atticus had retreated behind his newspaper and AuntAlexandra was worrying her embroidery. Punk, punk, punk, her needle broke the tautcircle. She stopped, and pulled the cloth tighter: punk-punk-punk. She was furious.
Jem got up and padded across the rug. He motioned me to follow. He led me to hisroom and closed the door. His face was grave.
¡°They¡¯ve been fussing, Scout.¡±
Jem and I fussed a great deal these days, but I had never heard of or seen anyonequarrel with Atticus. It was not a comfortable sight.
¡°Scout, try not to antagonize Aunty, hear?¡±
Atticus¡¯s remarks were still rankling, which made me miss the request in Jem¡¯squestion. My feathers rose again. ¡°You tryin¡® to tell me what to do?¡±
¡°Naw, it¡¯s¡ªhe¡¯s got a lot on his mind now, without us worrying him.¡±
¡°Like what?¡± Atticus didn¡¯t appear to have anything especially on his mind.
¡°It¡¯s this Tom Robinson case that¡¯s worryin¡® him to death¡ª¡±
I said Atticus didn¡¯t worry about anything. Besides, the case never bothered us exceptabout once a week and then it didn¡¯t last.
¡°That¡¯s because you can¡¯t hold something in your mind but a little while,¡± said Jem.
¡°It¡¯s different with grown folks, we¡ª¡±
His maddening superiority was unbearable these days. He didn¡¯t want to do anythingbut read and go off by himself. Still, everything he read he passed along to me, but withthis difference: formerly, because he thought I¡¯d like it; now, for my edification andinstruction.
¡°Jee crawling hova, Jem! Who do you think you are?¡±
¡°Now I mean it, Scout, you antagonize Aunty and I¡¯ll¡ªI¡¯ll spank you.¡±
With that, I was gone. ¡°You damn morphodite, I¡¯ll kill you!¡± He was sitting on the bed,and it was easy to grab his front hair and land one on his mouth. He slapped me and Itried another left, but a punch in the stomach sent me sprawling on the floor. It nearlyknocked the breath out of me, but it didn¡¯t matter because I knew he was fighting, hewas fighting me back. We were still equals.
¡°Ain¡¯t so high and mighty now, are you!¡± I screamed, sailing in again. He was still onthe bed and I couldn¡¯t get a firm stance, so I threw myself at him as hard as I could,hitting, pulling, pinching, gouging. What had begun as a fist-fight became a brawl. Wewere still struggling when Atticus separated us.
¡°That¡¯s all,¡± he said. ¡°Both of you go to bed right now.¡±
¡°Taah!¡± I said at Jem. He was being sent to bed at my bedtime.
¡°Who started it?¡± asked Atticus, in resignation.
¡°Jem did. He was tryin¡® to tell me what to do. I don¡¯t have to mind him now, do I?¡±
Atticus smiled. ¡°Let¡¯s leave it at this: you mind Jem whenever he can make you. Fairenough?¡±
Aunt Alexandra was present but silent, and when she went down the hall with Atticuswe heard her say, ¡°¡­just one of the things I¡¯ve been telling you about,¡± a phrase thatunited us again.
Ours were adjoining rooms; as I shut the door between them Jem said, ¡°Night, Scout.¡±
¡°Night,¡± I murmured, picking my way across the room to turn on the light. As I passedthe bed I stepped on something warm, resilient, and rather smooth. It was not quite likehard rubber, and I had the sensation that it was alive. I also heard it move.
I switched on the light and looked at the floor by the bed. Whatever I had stepped onwas gone. I tapped on Jem¡¯s door.
¡°What,¡± he said.
¡°How does a snake feel?¡±
¡°Sort of rough. Cold. Dusty. Why?¡±
¡°I think there¡¯s one under my bed. Can you come look?¡±
¡°Are you bein¡® funny?¡± Jem opened the door. He was in his pajama bottoms. I noticednot without satisfaction that the mark of my knuckles was still on his mouth. When hesaw I meant what I said, he said, ¡°If you think I¡¯m gonna put my face down to a snakeyou¡¯ve got another think comin¡¯. Hold on a minute.¡±
He went to the kitchen and fetched the broom. ¡°You better get up on the bed,¡± he said.
¡°You reckon it¡¯s really one?¡± I asked. This was an occasion. Our houses had nocellars; they were built on stone blocks a few feet above the ground, and the entry ofreptiles was not unknown but was not commonplace. Miss Rachel Haverford¡¯s excusefor a glass of neat whiskey every morning was that she never got over the fright offinding a rattler coiled in her bedroom closet, on her washing, when she went to hang upher negligee.
Jem made a tentative swipe under the bed. I looked over the foot to see if a snakewould come out. None did. Jem made a deeper swipe.
¡°Do snakes grunt?¡±
¡°It ain¡¯t a snake,¡± Jem said. ¡°It¡¯s somebody.¡±
Suddenly a filthy brown package shot from under the bed. Jem raised the broom andmissed Dill¡¯s head by an inch when it appeared.
¡°God Almighty.¡± Jem¡¯s voice was reverent.
We watched Dill emerge by degrees. He was a tight fit. He stood up and eased hisshoulders, turned his feet in their ankle sockets, rubbed the back of his neck. Hiscirculation restored, he said, ¡°Hey.¡±
Jem petitioned God again. I was speechless.
¡°I¡¯m ¡®bout to perish,¡± said Dill. ¡°Got anything to eat?¡±
In a dream, I went to the kitchen. I brought him back some milk and half a pan of cornbread left over from supper. Dill devoured it, chewing with his front teeth, as was hiscustom.
I finally found my voice. ¡°How¡¯d you get here?¡±
By an involved route. Refreshed by food, Dill recited this narrative: having been boundin chains and left to die in the basement (there were basements in Meridian) by his newfather, who disliked him, and secretly kept alive on raw field peas by a passing farmerwho heard his cries for help (the good man poked a bushel pod by pod through theventilator), Dill worked himself free by pulling the chains from the wall. Still in wristmanacles, he wandered two miles out of Meridian where he discovered a small animalshow and was immediately engaged to wash the camel. He traveled with the show allover Mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he was in Abbott County,Alabama, just across the river from Maycomb. He walked the rest of the way.
¡°How¡¯d you get here?¡± asked Jem.
He had taken thirteen dollars from his mother¡¯s purse, caught the nine o¡¯clock fromMeridian and got off at Maycomb Junction. He had walked ten or eleven of the fourteenmiles to Maycomb, off the highway in the scrub bushes lest the authorities be seekinghim, and had ridden the remainder of the way clinging to the backboard of a cottonwagon. He had been under the bed for two hours, he thought; he had heard us in thediningroom, and the clink of forks on plates nearly drove him crazy. He thought Jem andI would never go to bed; he had considered emerging and helping me beat Jem, as Jemhad grown far taller, but he knew Mr. Finch would break it up soon, so he thought it bestto stay where he was. He was worn out, dirty beyond belief, and home.
¡°They must not know you¡¯re here,¡± said Jem. ¡°We¡¯d know if they were lookin¡® foryou¡­¡±
¡°Think they¡¯re still searchin¡® all the picture shows in Meridian.¡± Dill grinned.
¡°You oughta let your mother know where you are,¡± said Jem. ¡°You oughta let her knowyou¡¯re here¡­¡±
Dill¡¯s eyes flickered at Jem, and Jem looked at the floor. Then he rose and broke theremaining code of our childhood. He went out of the room and down the hall. ¡°Atticus,¡±
his voice was distant, ¡°can you come here a minute, sir?¡±
Beneath its sweat-streaked dirt Dill¡¯s face went white. I felt sick. Atticus was in thedoorway.
He came to the middle of the room and stood with his hands in his pockets, lookingdown at Dill.
I finally found my voice: ¡°It¡¯s okay, Dill. When he wants you to know somethin¡®, he tellsyou.¡±
Dill looked at me. ¡°I mean it¡¯s all right,¡± I said. ¡°You know he wouldn¡¯t bother you, youknow you ain¡¯t scared of Atticus.¡±
¡°I¡¯m not scared¡­¡± Dill muttered.
¡°Just hungry, I¡¯ll bet.¡± Atticus¡¯s voice had its usual pleasant dryness. ¡°Scout, we can dobetter than a pan of cold corn bread, can¡¯t we? You fill this fellow up and when I getback we¡¯ll see what we can see.¡±
¡°Mr. Finch, don¡¯t tell Aunt Rachel, don¡¯t make me go back, please sir! I¡¯ll run offagain¡ª!¡±
¡°Whoa, son,¡± said Atticus. ¡°Nobody¡¯s about to make you go anywhere but to bed prettysoon. I¡¯m just going over to tell Miss Rachel you¡¯re here and ask her if you could spendthe night with us¡ªyou¡¯d like that, wouldn¡¯t you? And for goodness¡¯ sake put some of thecounty back where it belongs, the soil erosion¡¯s bad enough as it is.¡±
Dill stared at my father¡¯s retreating figure.
¡°He¡¯s tryin¡® to be funny,¡± I said. ¡°He means take a bath. See there, I told you hewouldn¡¯t bother you.¡±
Jem was standing in a corner of the room, looking like the traitor he was. ¡°Dill, I had totell him,¡± he said. ¡°You can¡¯t run three hundred miles off without your mother knowin¡®.¡±
We left him without a word.
Dill ate, and ate, and ate. He hadn¡¯t eaten since last night. He used all his money for aticket, boarded the train as he had done many times, coolly chatted with the conductor,to whom Dill was a familiar sight, but he had not the nerve to invoke the rule on smallchildren traveling a distance alone if you¡¯ve lost your money the conductor will lend youenough for dinner and your father will pay him back at the end of the line.
Dill made his way through the leftovers and was reaching for a can of pork and beansin the pantry when Miss Rachel¡¯s Do-oo Je-sus went off in the hall. He shivered like arabbit.
He bore with fortitude her Wait Till I Get You Home, Your Folks Are Out of Their MindsWorryin¡®, was quite calm during That¡¯s All the Harris in You Coming Out, smiled at herReckon You Can Stay One Night, and returned the hug at long last bestowed upon him.
Atticus pushed up his glasses and rubbed his face.
¡°Your father¡¯s tired,¡± said Aunt Alexandra, her first words in hours, it seemed. She hadbeen there, but I suppose struck dumb most of the time. ¡°You children get to bed now.¡±
We left them in the diningroom, Atticus still mopping his face. ¡°From rape to riot torunaways,¡± we heard him chuckle. ¡°I wonder what the next two hours will bring.¡±
Since things appeared to have worked out pretty well, Dill and I decided to be civil toJem. Besides, Dill had to sleep with him so we might as well speak to him.
I put on my pajamas, read for a while and found myself suddenly unable to keep myeyes open. Dill and Jem were quiet; when I turned off my reading lamp there was nostrip of light under the door to Jem¡¯s room.
I must have slept a long time, for when I was punched awake the room was dim withthe light of the setting moon.
¡°Move over, Scout.¡±
¡°He thought he had to,¡± I mumbled. ¡°Don¡¯t stay mad with him.¡±
Dill got in bed beside me. ¡°I ain¡¯t,¡± he said. ¡°I just wanted to sleep with you. Are youwaked up?¡±
By this time I was, but lazily so. ¡°Why¡¯d you do it?¡±
No answer. ¡°I said why¡¯d you run off? Was he really hateful like you said?¡±
¡°Naw¡­¡±
¡°Didn¡¯t you all build that boat like you wrote you were gonna?¡±
¡°He just said we would. We never did.¡±
I raised up on my elbow, facing Dill¡¯s outline. ¡°It¡¯s no reason to run off. They don¡¯t getaround to doin¡® what they say they¡¯re gonna do half the time¡­¡±
¡°That wasn¡¯t it, he¡ªthey just wasn¡¯t interested in me.¡±
This was the weirdest reason for flight I had ever heard. ¡°How come?¡±
¡°Well, they stayed gone all the time, and when they were home, even, they¡¯d get off ina room by themselves.¡±
¡°What¡¯d they do in there?¡±
¡°Nothin¡®, just sittin¡¯ and readin¡®¡ªbut they didn¡¯t want me with ¡¯em.¡±
I pushed the pillow to the headboard and sat up. ¡°You know something? I was fixin¡® torun off tonight because there they all were. You don¡¯t want ¡¯em around you all the time,Dill¡ª¡±
Dill breathed his patient breath, a half-sigh.
¡°¡ªgood night, Atticus¡¯s gone all day and sometimes half the night and off in thelegislature and I don¡¯t know what¡ªyou don¡¯t want ¡®em around all the time, Dill, youcouldn¡¯t do anything if they were.¡±
¡°That¡¯s not it.¡±
As Dill explained, I found myself wondering what life would be if Jem were different,even from what he was now; what I would do if Atticus did not feel the necessity of mypresence, help and advice. Why, he couldn¡¯t get along a day without me. EvenCalpurnia couldn¡¯t get along unless I was there. They needed me.
¡°Dill, you ain¡¯t telling me right¡ªyour folks couldn¡¯t do without you. They must be justmean to you. Tell you what to do about that¡ª¡±
Dill¡¯s voice went on steadily in the darkness: ¡°The thing is, what I¡¯m tryin¡® to say is¡ªthey do get on a lot better without me, I can¡¯t help them any. They ain¡¯t mean. They buyme everything I want, but it¡¯s now¡ªyou¡¯ve-got-it-go-play-with-it. You¡¯ve got a roomful ofthings. I-got-you-that-book-so-go-read-it.¡± Dill tried to deepen his voice. ¡°You¡¯re not aboy. Boys get out and play baseball with other boys, they don¡¯t hang around the houseworryin¡¯ their folks.¡±
Dill¡¯s voice was his own again: ¡°Oh, they ain¡¯t mean. They kiss you and hug you goodnight and good mornin¡® and good-bye and tell you they love you¡ªScout, let¡¯s get us ababy.¡±
¡°Where?¡±
There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggyisland where all these babies were; you could order one¡ª¡°That¡¯s a lie. Aunty said God drops ¡®em down the chimney. At least that¡¯s what I thinkshe said.¡± For once, Aunty¡¯s diction had not been too clear.
¡°Well that ain¡¯t so. You get babies from each other. But there¡¯s this man, too¡ªhe hasall these babies just waitin¡® to wake up, he breathes life into ¡¯em¡­¡±
Dill was off again. Beautiful things floated around in his dreamy head. He could readtwo books to my one, but he preferred the magic of his own inventions. He could addand subtract faster than lightning, but he preferred his own twilight world, a world wherebabies slept, waiting to be gathered like morning lilies. He was slowly talking himself tosleep and taking me with him, but in the quietness of his foggy island there rose thefaded image of a gray house with sad brown doors.
¡°Dill?¡±
¡°Mm?¡±
¡°Why do you reckon Boo Radley¡¯s never run off?¡±
Dill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me.
¡°Maybe he doesn¡¯t have anywhere to run off to¡­¡±After many telephone calls, much pleading on behalf of the defendant, and a longforgiving letter from his mother, it was decided that Dill could stay. We had a week ofpeace together. After that, little, it seemed. A nightmare was upon us.
It began one evening after supper. Dill was over; Aunt Alexandra was in her chair inthe corner, Atticus was in his; Jem and I were on the floor reading. It had been a placidweek: I had minded Aunty; Jem had outgrown the treehouse, but helped Dill and meconstruct a new rope ladder for it; Dill had hit upon a foolproof plan to make Boo Radleycome out at no cost to ourselves (place a trail of lemon drops from the back door to thefront yard and he¡¯d follow it, like an ant). There was a knock on the front door, Jemanswered it and said it was Mr. Heck Tate.
¡°Well, ask him to come in,¡± said Atticus.
¡°I already did. There¡¯s some men outside in the yard, they want you to come out.¡±
In Maycomb, grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reasons: deathand politics. I wondered who had died. Jem and I went to the front door, but Atticuscalled, ¡°Go back in the house.¡±
Jem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window screen. AuntAlexandra protested. ¡°Just for a second, Aunty, let¡¯s see who it is,¡± he said.
Dill and I took another window. A crowd of men was standing around Atticus. They allseemed to be talking at once.
¡°¡­movin¡® him to the county jail tomorrow,¡± Mr. Tate was saying, ¡°I don¡¯t look for anytrouble, but I can¡¯t guarantee there won¡¯t be any¡­¡±
¡°Don¡¯t be foolish, Heck,¡± Atticus said. ¡°This is Maycomb.¡±
¡°¡­said I was just uneasy.¡±
¡°Heck, we¡¯ve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure there¡¯s nothingto be uneasy about. This is Saturday,¡± Atticus said. ¡°Trial¡¯ll probably be Monday. Youcan keep him one night, can¡¯t you? I don¡¯t think anybody in Maycomb¡¯ll begrudge me aclient, with times this hard.¡±
There was a murmur of glee that died suddenly when Mr. Link Deas said, ¡°Nobodyaround here¡¯s up to anything, it¡¯s that Old Sarum bunch I¡¯m worried about¡­ can¡¯t youget a¡ªwhat is it, Heck?¡±
¡°Change of venue,¡± said Mr. Tate. ¡°Not much point in that, now is it?¡±
Atticus said something inaudible. I turned to Jem, who waved me to silence.
¡°¡ªbesides,¡± Atticus was saying, ¡°you¡¯re not scared of that crowd, are you?¡±
¡°¡­know how they do when they get shinnied up.¡±
¡°They don¡¯t usually drink on Sunday, they go to church most of the day¡­¡± Atticus said.
¡°This is a special occasion, though¡­¡± someone said.
They murmured and buzzed until Aunty said if Jem didn¡¯t turn on the livingroom lightshe would disgrace the family. Jem didn¡¯t hear her.
¡°¡ªdon¡¯t see why you touched it in the first place,¡± Mr. Link Deas was saying. ¡°You¡¯vegot everything to lose from this, Atticus. I mean everything.¡±
¡°Do you really think so?¡±
This was Atticus¡¯s dangerous question. ¡°Do you really think you want to move there,Scout?¡± Bam, bam, bam, and the checkerboard was swept clean of my men. ¡°Do youreally think that, son? Then read this.¡± Jem would struggle the rest of an eveningthrough the speeches of Henry W. Grady.
¡°Link, that boy might go to the chair, but he¡¯s not going till the truth¡¯s told.¡± Atticus¡¯svoice was even. ¡°And you know what the truth is.¡±
There was a murmur among the group of men, made more ominous when Atticusmoved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to him.
Suddenly Jem screamed, ¡°Atticus, the telephone¡¯s ringing!¡±
The men jumped a little and scattered; they were people we saw every day:
merchants, in-town farmers; Dr. Reynolds was there; so was Mr. Avery.
¡°Well, answer it, son,¡± called Atticus.
Laughter broke them up. When Atticus switched on the overhead light in thelivingroom he found Jem at the window, pale except for the vivid mark of the screen onhis nose.
¡°Why on earth are you all sitting in the dark?¡± he asked.
Jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper. I sometimes thinkAtticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil evaluation behind The MobileRegister, The Birmingham News and The Montgomery Advertiser.
¡°They were after you, weren¡¯t they?¡± Jem went to him. ¡°They wanted to get you, didn¡¯tthey?¡±
Atticus lowered the paper and gazed at Jem. ¡°What have you been reading?¡± heasked. Then he said gently, ¡°No son, those were our friends.¡±
¡°It wasn¡¯t a¡ªa gang?¡± Jem was looking from the corners of his eyes.
Atticus tried to stifle a smile but didn¡¯t make it. ¡°No, we don¡¯t have mobs and thatnonsense in Maycomb. I¡¯ve never heard of a gang in Maycomb.¡±
¡°Ku Klux got after some Catholics one time.¡±
¡°Never heard of any Catholics in Maycomb either,¡± said Atticus, ¡°you¡¯re confusing thatwith something else. Way back about nineteen-twenty there was a Klan, but it was apolitical organization more than anything. Besides, they couldn¡¯t find anybody to scare.
They paraded by Mr. Sam Levy¡¯s house one night, but Sam just stood on his porch andtold ¡®em things had come to a pretty pass, he¡¯d sold ¡¯em the very sheets on their backs.
Sam made ¡®em so ashamed of themselves they went away.¡±
The Levy family met all criteria for being Fine Folks: they did the best they could withthe sense they had, and they had been living on the same plot of ground in Maycombfor five generations.
¡°The Ku Klux¡¯s gone,¡± said Atticus. ¡°It¡¯ll never come back.¡±
I walked home with Dill and returned in time to overhear Atticus saying to Aunty, ¡°¡­infavor of Southern womanhood as much as anybody, but not for preserving polite fictionat the expense of human life,¡± a pronouncement that made me suspect they had beenfussing again.
I sought Jem and found him in his room, on the bed deep in thought. ¡°Have they beenat it?¡± I asked.
¡°Sort of. She won¡¯t let him alone about Tom Robinson. She almost said Atticus wasdisgracin¡® the family. Scout¡­ I¡¯m scared.¡±
¡°Scared¡¯a what?¡±
¡°Scared about Atticus. Somebody might hurt him.¡± Jem preferred to remainmysterious; all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone.
Next day was Sunday. In the interval between Sunday School and Church when thecongregation stretched its legs, I saw Atticus standing in the yard with another knot ofmen. Mr. Heck Tate was present, and I wondered if he had seen the light. He neverwent to church. Even Mr. Underwood was there. Mr. Underwood had no use for anyorganization but The Maycomb Tribune, of which he was the sole owner, editor, andprinter. His days were spent at his linotype, where he refreshed himself occasionallyfrom an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. He rarely gathered news; people broughtit to him. It was said that he made up every edition of The Maycomb Tribune out of hisown head and wrote it down on the linotype. This was believable. Something must havebeen up to haul Mr. Underwood out.
I caught Atticus coming in the door, and he said that they¡¯d moved Tom Robinson tothe Maycomb jail. He also said, more to himself than to me, that if they¡¯d kept him therein the first place there wouldn¡¯t have been any fuss. I watched him take his seat on thethird row from the front, and I heard him rumble, ¡°Nearer my God to thee,¡± some notesbehind the rest of us. He never sat with Aunty, Jem and me. He liked to be by himself inchurch.
The fake peace that prevailed on Sundays was made more irritating by AuntAlexandra¡¯s presence. Atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner, where if wesometimes looked in on him, we would find him sitting back in his swivel chair reading.
Aunt Alexandra composed herself for a two-hour nap and dared us to make any noise inthe yard, the neighborhood was resting. Jem in his old age had taken to his room with astack of football magazines. So Dill and I spent our Sundays creeping around in Deer¡¯sPasture.
Shooting on Sundays was prohibited, so Dill and I kicked Jem¡¯s football around thepasture for a while, which was no fun. Dill asked if I¡¯d like to have a poke at Boo Radley.
I said I didn¡¯t think it¡¯d be nice to bother him, and spent the rest of the afternoon fillingDill in on last winter¡¯s events. He was considerably impressed.
We parted at suppertime, and after our meal Jem and I were settling down to a routineevening, when Atticus did something that interested us: he came into the livingroomcarrying a long electrical extension cord. There was a light bulb on the end.
¡°I¡¯m going out for a while,¡± he said. ¡°You folks¡¯ll be in bed when I come back, so I¡¯ll saygood night now.¡±
With that, he put his hat on and went out the back door.
¡°He¡¯s takin¡® the car,¡± said Jem.
Our father had a few peculiarities: one was, he never ate desserts; another was thathe liked to walk. As far back as I could remember, there was always a Chevrolet inexcellent condition in the carhouse, and Atticus put many miles on it in business trips,but in Maycomb he walked to and from his office four times a day, covering about twomiles. He said his only exercise was walking. In Maycomb, if one went for a walk with nodefinite purpose in mind, it was correct to believe one¡¯s mind incapable of definitepurpose.
Later on, I bade my aunt and brother good night and was well into a book when Iheard Jem rattling around in his room. His go-to-bed noises were so familiar to me that Iknocked on his door: ¡°Why ain¡¯t you going to bed?¡±
¡°I¡¯m goin¡® downtown for a while.¡± He was changing his pants.
¡°Why? It¡¯s almost ten o¡¯clock, Jem.¡±
He knew it, but he was going anyway.
¡°Then I¡¯m goin¡® with you. If you say no you¡¯re not, I¡¯m goin¡¯ anyway, hear?¡±
Jem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home, and I suppose he thought afight would antagonize Aunty, so he gave in with little grace.
I dressed quickly. We waited until Aunty¡¯s light went out, and we walked quietly downthe back steps. There was no moon tonight.
¡°Dill¡¯ll wanta come,¡± I whispered.
¡°So he will,¡± said Jem gloomily.
We leaped over the driveway wall, cut through Miss Rachel¡¯s side yard and went toDill¡¯s window. Jem whistled bob-white. Dill¡¯s face appeared at the screen, disappeared,and five minutes later he unhooked the screen and crawled out. An old campaigner, hedid not speak until we were on the sidewalk. ¡°What¡¯s up?¡±
¡°Jem¡¯s got the look-arounds,¡± an affliction Calpurnia said all boys caught at his age.
¡°I¡¯ve just got this feeling,¡± Jem said, ¡°just this feeling.¡±
We went by Mrs. Dubose¡¯s house, standing empty and shuttered, her camellias grownup in weeds and johnson grass. There were eight more houses to the post office corner.
The south side of the square was deserted. Giant monkey-puzzle bushes bristled oneach corner, and between them an iron hitching rail glistened under the street lights. Alight shone in the county toilet, otherwise that side of the courthouse was dark. A largersquare of stores surrounded the courthouse square; dim lights burned from deep withinthem.
Atticus¡¯s office was in the courthouse when he began his law practice, but afterseveral years of it he moved to quieter quarters in the Maycomb Bank building. Whenwe rounded the corner of the square, we saw the car parked in front of the bank. ¡°He¡¯sin there,¡± said Jem.
But he wasn¡¯t. His office was reached by a long hallway. Looking down the hall, weshould have seen Atticus Finch, Attorney-at-Law in small sober letters against the lightfrom behind his door. It was dark.
Jem peered in the bank door to make sure. He turned the knob. The door was locked.
¡°Let¡¯s go up the street. Maybe he¡¯s visitin¡® Mr. Underwood.¡±
Mr. Underwood not only ran The Maycomb Tribune office, he lived in it. That is, aboveit. He covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his upstairswindow. The office building was on the northwest corner of the square, and to reach itwe had to pass the jail.
The Maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the county¡¯s buildings.
Atticus said it was like something Cousin Joshua St. Clair might have designed. It wascertainly someone¡¯s dream. Starkly out of place in a town of square-faced stores andsteep-roofed houses, the Maycomb jail was a miniature Gothic joke one cell wide andtwo cells high, complete with tiny battlements and flying buttresses. Its fantasy washeightened by its red brick facade and the thick steel bars at its ecclesiastical windows.
It stood on no lonely hill, but was wedged between Tyndal¡¯s Hardware Store and TheMaycomb Tribune office. The jail was Maycomb¡¯s only conversation piece: its detractorssaid it looked like a Victorian privy; its supporters said it gave the town a good solidrespectable look, and no stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers.
As we walked up the sidewalk, we saw a solitary light burning in the distance. ¡°That¡¯sfunny,¡± said Jem, ¡°jail doesn¡¯t have an outside light.¡±
¡°Looks like it¡¯s over the door,¡± said Dill.
A long extension cord ran between the bars of a second-floor window and down theside of the building. In the light from its bare bulb, Atticus was sitting propped againstthe front door. He was sitting in one of his office chairs, and he was reading, oblivious ofthe nightbugs dancing over his head.
I made to run, but Jem caught me. ¡°Don¡¯t go to him,¡± he said, ¡°he might not like it. He¡¯sall right, let¡¯s go home. I just wanted to see where he was.¡±
We were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty cars came in from theMeridian highway, moving slowly in a line. They went around the square, passed thebank building, and stopped in front of the jail.
Nobody got out. We saw Atticus look up from his newspaper. He closed it, folded itdeliberately, dropped it in his lap, and pushed his hat to the back of his head. Heseemed to be expecting them.
¡°Come on,¡± whispered Jem. We streaked across the square, across the street, untilwe were in the shelter of the Jitney Jungle door. Jem peeked up the sidewalk. ¡°We canget closer,¡± he said. We ran to Tyndal¡¯s Hardware door¡ªnear enough, at the same timediscreet.
In ones and twos, men got out of the cars. Shadows became substance as lightsrevealed solid shapes moving toward the jail door. Atticus remained where he was. Themen hid him from view.
¡°He in there, Mr. Finch?¡± a man said.
¡°He is,¡± we heard Atticus answer, ¡°and he¡¯s asleep. Don¡¯t wake him up.¡±
In obedience to my father, there followed what I later realized was a sickeningly comicaspect of an unfunny situation: the men talked in near-whispers.
¡°You know what we want,¡± another man said. ¡°Get aside from the door, Mr. Finch.¡±
¡°You can turn around and go home again, Walter,¡± Atticus said pleasantly. ¡°HeckTate¡¯s around somewhere.¡±
¡°The hell he is,¡± said another man. ¡°Heck¡¯s bunch¡¯s so deep in the woods they won¡¯tget out till mornin¡®.¡±
¡°Indeed? Why so?¡±
¡°Called ¡®em off on a snipe hunt,¡± was the succinct answer. ¡°Didn¡¯t you think a¡¯that, Mr.
Finch?¡±
¡°Thought about it, but didn¡¯t believe it. Well then,¡± my father¡¯s voice was still the same,¡°that changes things, doesn¡¯t it?¡±
¡°It do,¡± another deep voice said. Its owner was a shadow.
¡°Do you really think so?¡±
This was the second time I heard Atticus ask that question in two days, and it meantsomebody¡¯s man would get jumped. This was too good to miss. I broke away from Jemand ran as fast as I could to Atticus.
Jem shrieked and tried to catch me, but I had a lead on him and Dill. I pushed my waythrough dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of light.
¡°H-ey, Atticus!¡±
I thought he would have a fine surprise, but his face killed my joy. A flash of plain fearwas going out of his eyes, but returned when Dill and Jem wriggled into the light.
There was a smell of stale whiskey and pigpen about, and when I glanced around Idiscovered that these men were strangers. They were not the people I saw last night.
Hot embarrassment shot through me: I had leaped triumphantly into a ring of people Ihad never seen before.
Atticus got up from his chair, but he was moving slowly, like an old man. He put thenewspaper down very carefully, adjusting its creases with lingering fingers. They weretrembling a little.
¡°Go home, Jem,¡± he said. ¡°Take Scout and Dill home.¡±
We were accustomed to prompt, if not always cheerful acquiescence to Atticus¡¯sinstructions, but from the way he stood Jem was not thinking of budging.
¡°Go home, I said.¡±
Jem shook his head. As Atticus¡¯s fists went to his hips, so did Jem¡¯s, and as theyfaced each other I could see little resemblance between them: Jem¡¯s soft brown hairand eyes, his oval face and snug-fitting ears were our mother¡¯s, contrasting oddly withAtticus¡¯s graying black hair and square-cut features, but they were somehow alike.
Mutual defiance made them alike.
¡°Son, I said go home.¡±
Jem shook his head.
¡°I¡¯ll send him home,¡± a burly man said, and grabbed Jem roughly by the collar. Heyanked Jem nearly off his feet.
¡°Don¡¯t you touch him!¡± I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was surprised to see himfall back in real pain. I intended to kick his shin, but aimed too high.
¡°That¡¯ll do, Scout.¡± Atticus put his hand on my shoulder. ¡°Don¡¯t kick folks. No¡ª¡± hesaid, as I was pleading justification.
¡°Ain¡¯t nobody gonna do Jem that way,¡± I said.
¡°All right, Mr. Finch, get ¡®em outa here,¡± someone growled. ¡°You got fifteen seconds toget ¡¯em outa here.¡±
In the midst of this strange assembly, Atticus stood trying to make Jem mind him. ¡°Iain¡¯t going,¡± was his steady answer to Atticus¡¯s threats, requests, and finally, ¡°PleaseJem, take them home.¡±
I was getting a bit tired of that, but felt Jem had his own reasons for doing as he did, inview of his prospects once Atticus did get him home. I looked around the crowd. It was asummer¡¯s night, but the men were dressed, most of them, in overalls and denim shirtsbuttoned up to the collars. I thought they must be cold-natured, as their sleeves wereunrolled and buttoned at the cuffs. Some wore hats pulled firmly down over their ears.
They were sullen-looking, sleepy-eyed men who seemed unused to late hours. I soughtonce more for a familiar face, and at the center of the semi-circle I found one.
¡°Hey, Mr. Cunningham.¡±
The man did not hear me, it seemed.
¡°Hey, Mr. Cunningham. How¡¯s your entailment gettin¡® along?¡±
Mr. Walter Cunningham¡¯s legal affairs were well known to me; Atticus had oncedescribed them at length. The big man blinked and hooked his thumbs in his overallstraps. He seemed uncomfortable; he cleared his throat and looked away. My friendlyoverture had fallen flat.
Mr. Cunningham wore no hat, and the top half of his forehead was white in contrast tohis sunscorched face, which led me to believe that he wore one most days. He shiftedhis feet, clad in heavy work shoes.
¡°Don¡¯t you remember me, Mr. Cunningham? I¡¯m Jean Louise Finch. You brought ussome hickory nuts one time, remember?¡± I began to sense the futility one feels whenunacknowledged by a chance acquaintance.
¡°I go to school with Walter,¡± I began again. ¡°He¡¯s your boy, ain¡¯t he? Ain¡¯t he, sir?¡±
Mr. Cunningham was moved to a faint nod. He did know me, after all.
¡°He¡¯s in my grade,¡± I said, ¡°and he does right well. He¡¯s a good boy,¡± I added, ¡°a realnice boy. We brought him home for dinner one time. Maybe he told you about me, I beathim up one time but he was real nice about it. Tell him hey for me, won¡¯t you?¡±
Atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they wereinterested in, not about what you were interested in. Mr. Cunningham displayed nointerest in his son, so I tackled his entailment once more in a last-ditch effort to makehim feel at home.
¡°Entailments are bad,¡± I was advising him, when I slowly awoke to the fact that I wasaddressing the entire aggregation. The men were all looking at me, some had theirmouths half-open. Atticus had stopped poking at Jem: they were standing togetherbeside Dill. Their attention amounted to fascination. Atticus¡¯s mouth, even, was half-open, an attitude he had once described as uncouth. Our eyes met and he shut it.
¡°Well, Atticus, I was just sayin¡® to Mr. Cunningham that entailments are bad an¡¯ allthat, but you said not to worry, it takes a long time sometimes¡­ that you all¡¯d ride it outtogether¡­¡± I was slowly drying up, wondering what idiocy I had committed. Entailmentsseemed all right enough for livingroom talk.
I began to feel sweat gathering at the edges of my hair; I could stand anything but abunch of people looking at me. They were quite still.
¡°What¡¯s the matter?¡± I asked.
Atticus said nothing. I looked around and up at Mr. Cunningham, whose face wasequally impassive. Then he did a peculiar thing. He squatted down and took me by bothshoulders.
¡°I¡¯ll tell him you said hey, little lady,¡± he said.
Then he straightened up and waved a big paw. ¡°Let¡¯s clear out,¡± he called. ¡°Let¡¯s getgoing, boys.¡±
As they had come, in ones and twos the men shuffled back to their ramshackle cars.
Doors slammed, engines coughed, and they were gone.
I turned to Atticus, but Atticus had gone to the jail and was leaning against it with hisface to the wall. I went to him and pulled his sleeve. ¡°Can we go home now?¡± Henodded, produced his handkerchief, gave his face a going-over and blew his noseviolently.
¡°Mr. Finch?¡±
A soft husky voice came from the darkness above: ¡°They gone?¡±
Atticus stepped back and looked up. ¡°They¡¯ve gone,¡± he said. ¡°Get some sleep, Tom.
They won¡¯t bother you any more.¡±
From a different direction, another voice cut crisply through the night: ¡°You¡¯re damntootin¡® they won¡¯t. Had you covered all the time, Atticus.¡±
Mr. Underwood and a double-barreled shotgun were leaning out his window aboveThe Maycomb Tribune office.
It was long past my bedtime and I was growing quite tired; it seemed that Atticus andMr. Underwood would talk for the rest of the night, Mr. Underwood out the window andAtticus up at him. Finally Atticus returned, switched off the light above the jail door, andpicked up his chair.
¡°Can I carry it for you, Mr. Finch?¡± asked Dill. He had not said a word the whole time.
¡°Why, thank you, son.¡±
Walking toward the office, Dill and I fell into step behind Atticus and Jem. Dill wasencumbered by the chair, and his pace was slower. Atticus and Jem were well ahead ofus, and I assumed that Atticus was giving him hell for not going home, but I was wrong.
As they passed under a streetlight, Atticus reached out and massaged Jem¡¯s hair, hisone gesture of affection.
